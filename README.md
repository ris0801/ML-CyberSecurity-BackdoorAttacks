# ML-CyberSecurity-BackdoorAttacks

## Data

I have downloaded the data, stored it onto the google drive and mounted into my colab. 
Data and models are stored in path -> data_path ="/content/gdrive/MyDrive/backdoor/data" and "/content/gdrive/MyDrive/backdoor/models"
Store data and model at appropriate location and change the value of data_path ="/content/gdrive/MyDrive/backdoor/data" in code.

## Evaluating the Backdoored Model:

All the code for evaluation has been incorporated in google colab
